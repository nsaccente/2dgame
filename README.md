## Coloring for Colorblindness

We will be using a color pallet suggested by Bang Wong 
in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1618). 

This paper is paywalled, which is stupid, but 
[this site](https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23000000-%23E69F00-%2356B4E9-%23009E73-%23F0E442-%230072B2-%23D55E00-%23CC79A7)
has a screenshot of their pallet.

The colors are:

```yaml
- "#e69f00"  # mustard yellow
- "#56b4e9"  # baby blue
- "#009e73"  # dark cyan
- "#f0e342"  # peep yellow
- "#0072b2"  # royal blue
- "#d55e00"  # orange orange
- "#cc79a7"  # mauvy mauve
- "#000000"  # white
```
